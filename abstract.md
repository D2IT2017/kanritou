# Recreated of building by 3D model

In this study, a building which was destroyed by the Kumamoto Earthquake was recreated from designs using 3Dmodels.  
There are plans to rebuild this building, so we made a 3D model to keep records.  
We used SketchUp to recreate the building  
The 3D models will be shared at
